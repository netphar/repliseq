# repliseq
replication timing analysis for Aska et al 2022.

If you try to replicate the analysis, pay attention to the folder structure in the script files. Input files are in /raw_data, repliseq data from Zhao et al 2020 is downloaded from GEO. NB: GEO input files are *not* smoothed and scaled, despite what the filenames say. Results are in the /outputs.
