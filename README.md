# repliseq
replication timing analysis for Aska et al 2022, using repliseq data from Zhao et al 2020. 

If you try to replicate, pay attention to the folder structure in the script files. Input files are in /raw_data. NB GEO input files are *not* smoothed and scaled, despite what the filenames say. Results are in the /outputs.
